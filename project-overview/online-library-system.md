“The Online Library Management System” is a platform whose facilities are available to registered 
users, with the aim of simplifying library tasks. It automatically does the record keeping and make 
books' related information available to the users, and also keeps them updated regarding the new 
publications. Several interfaces are available to users for tasks which includes checking availability of 
the books, maintaining records, make to-be-read chart, and issuing books, including faculty members, 
students, and librarians. More so, the system enables the users to renew loans, manage late fees, and 
send recommendations to other members in the community for new books via internal messaging. 
Furthermore, each of the registered members are as well entitled with ID cards for their ease of access 
to the library, and in addition to that the users can also provide their reviews of the books they have 
already read, this project was submitted to **Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering, Prime 
University, Bangladesh for the partial fulfilment of my Bachelor degree**.
